### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

During my parental leave, I decided to rearrange my career and become a Frontend Developer some day. This is how my project started. I took my chances with Infoshare Academy and eventually I started to create my own application. 

During bootcamp I participated on 240h of workshops and gain knowlage about JavaScript, REST, JSON, AJAX, React, Redux, HTML5/CSS3, Git and scrum methodology. What is more I took part on group project and worked on QuoVadis web site and application. 

Besides taking part in Infoshare Academy and reading a lot of books and articles, my main is the Cithara project. Together with my beloved one, we have created a backlog and I started to develop on my own. The whole idea behind it, is to create a tool that will help those that are trying to learn how to play on the guitar. From the beginning I had to cope with some DevOps related tasks (set up Xcode or Android Studio in Docker enviroment, CI pipeline on GitLab) and finally I started to code. I decided to expand my knowledge, and I have picked up a different technology, which is suitable for Mobile Development. I chose React Native. I am slowly moving forward, completing next tasks from Product Backlog.

My main goal would be to seek opportunity in IT in the role of a Frontend Developer.
